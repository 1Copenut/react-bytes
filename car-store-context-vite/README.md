# Welcome to the Car Store
I'm leveling up on `React.Context` and looking for interesting ways to learn the concepts. I'm following along with the article [Working With the React Context API](https://www.toptal.com/react/react-context-api) for this first context app. I'm also using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for my build tool. Holy moly is it fast.
