# Context Theming

This app will continue the use of React Context for building a light and dark theme toggle started in the previous [context-theming app](https://github.com/1Copenut/react-bytes/tree/main/context-theming). This app will be similar, but uses [styled-components]https://styled-components.com/]() for theming.
