# React Portals

This app will explore building a feature-complete (er, mostly) modal dialog that uses [React Portal](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) to be appended after my app root. It uses the fantastic [react-focus-on library](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-on) to trap focus in the modal and prevent scrolling the page while the modal is open.
