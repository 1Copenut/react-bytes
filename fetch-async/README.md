# Fetch Async

This app will be built to fetch data asynchronously and use the return value to create a meaningful display.

The app uses the [FBI&rsquo;s Crime Data API](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/docApi) to report computer crime information. The first iteration focuses on those who committed crimes such as embezzlement, hacking, or fraud.
