# React Bytes
I can build components and design systems pretty well, but the "glue" code like
lifting up state, calling remote APIs, and higher-order components are still
somewhat fuzzy. It is high time to change that.

## This repository will be deprecated at some point TBD
It's getting to be a lot of work managing dependencies for each mini-project instead of a shared set, so I've started a new repository [react-bytes-mono](https://github.com/1Copenut/react-bytes-mono) where this work will continue. At some point I will archive this repository and update the README.
