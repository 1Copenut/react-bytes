# Error Boundary

This app will be built to test out React's [Error Boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html) for graceful fallback when things go wrong. And this is software development&mdash;things <strong>will</strong> go wrong.

## The details

I've created an `ErrorBound` class-based component that can be triggered by toggling the `hasError` state to true using the React dev tools. I'm working on a way to demonstrate it in a production setting. Check the resources below for more information.
